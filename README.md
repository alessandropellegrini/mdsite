This is my awesome mdsite!
==========================

How this is done
----------------

This is generated on the fly starting from some md files. But's that not everything! You can:

* Use the full MD syntaxt
* you can use as well directly php files
* You can hide files using a special name starting with "\_"
* TODO: finire di descrivere

---------------------------------------

Perfect decoupling
------------------

The main goal behind mdsite is to keep everything as simple as possible. You concentrate on the content when you write MD files. You concentrate on the design when you setup your layout. You can use directly HTML & CSS code when you design your site. Try this: this template is **responsive**!
