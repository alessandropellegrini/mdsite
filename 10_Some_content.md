This is a page with some content
================================

MD syntax is nice! Inserting [links](index.php5?p=/30_Contact_us) to other pages is easy. You can just use code like this:

    [links](index.php5?p=/30_Contact_us)

You can even use tables:

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

which render nicely even when looking at the source:

    | Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
    | ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
    | col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
    | col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
    | zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

Placing images is easy as well!

    ![alt text](img/dummy.png)

And you can even paste directly HTML code, for example to display a map!
